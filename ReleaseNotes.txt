Fixes in Mercurial since 0.3:

  * new built-in filemerge system replaces hgmerge patches
  * many fixes for keyword extension
  * new -U (context lines) argument for diff and qdiff commands

New features in 0.3

  * Major improvements to changelog browser.  It is now good enough to
    deprecate both hgk and hgview.  Neither are bundled with the 0.3
    binary installer, but both can be added by the user if they wish.
    Support for external revision log viewers will be dropped in 0.4.

  * The new changelog browser supports filtering by file pattern,
    keywords, dates, and branches.  It is capable of graphing both the
    repository changelog and individual filelogs.  Changeset coloring by
    author is optional (tortoisehg.authorcolor).  All changeset graphing
    is done incrementally in batches (tortoisehg.graphlimit: 500)

  * New DataMine application for searching history (hg grep) and
    inspecting file histories (hg annotate).  This new application is
    tabbed to facilitate debugging sessions where search results and
    annotations can be grouped together for easy cross-reference.

  * New changeset browser, supports multiple parents intrinsically and
    supports a number of file-revision features (view at revision, save
    at revision, annotate at revision, revert to revision, etc).  The
    new changeset browser is also integrated into the changelog browser.

  * Standardized window layouts.  Close buttons have been moved to the
    toolbar.  Dialogs that use progress bars now use a standard status
    bar/progress bar widget.  Tooltips have been added.

  * Hgtk wrapper application for launching TortoiseHg dialogs from the
    command line

  * Support for an external visual editor: tortoisehg.editor.  Takes
    precedence over ui.editor when viewing files with TortoiseHg

  * Performance improvements in Mercurial itself (cset 0973501e5f4a)

  * New installer bitmap from Peer Sommerlund

  * Misc: The Synchronize dialog has been improved.  The Web Serve
    dialog no longer requires a subprocess to run the web server.  The
    configuration dialog has a number of bug fixes for the paths tab,
    and now has separators in the drop-down boxes for the varying value
    types (current, suggested, history). Http authentication has been
    fixed.  The hg integration library has seen major cleanups.

Bug Fixes in 0.3:

  * [ 1863086 ] "Revision Graph" fail on UNC path
    Fixed by removing hgk from base install.  Integrated log viewer
    is UNC path safe.
  * [ 1851395 ] Total Commander problem
  * [ 1882074 ] global name 'p' is not defined
  * [ 1854443 ] View changelog fails

New features in 0.2

  * Gtools has been integrated into TortoiseHg proper. It is no longer
    bundled as a Mercurial extension. The graphlog extension is now enabled
    again by default (only usable from the CLI, however).

  * Context menu icons, application window icons. The context menu has been
    simplified.

  * The changelog browser has a number of new features (filters and context
    menu options). The tag browser and changelog tagging features have been
    merged into this tool.

  * Hgview is now the default history viewer, hgk is being deprecated.

  * An email dialog for interfacing with the patchbomb extension. It can be
    reached from the synchronize dialog and from the changelog browser.

  * A new configuration tool (replacing hg-config dialogs) that allows you
    to configure TortoiseHg and Mercurial.

  * Most dialogs now use HgThread and GtkUI to run hg commands. These
    classes run the command in a background thread and provide GUI prompts
    for when user interaction is necessary (http web auth, etc). For some
    commands, it also provides a progress bar.

  * A preview of the new Mercurial merge back end. The python hgmerge.py
    script is being integrated into Mercurial, and this installer has a
    preview of how that will work. You need to unset any ui.merge in your
    Mercurial.ini file in order for it to work properly. If you don't
    configure anything it will use simplemerge to automatically perform
    merges. If conflicts are found it falls back to kdiff3 to resolve
    them interactively.

  * Slight improvement on speed of overlay icons display.

  * A new 'about' dialog.

Bugs fixed in 0.2

  * [SF Bug #1851395] Overlay icons and context menus are no longer
    restricted to MS-Explorer. So other file managers, such as Total
    Commander, should be supported.

  * [SF Bug #1844722] Users can now create repositories inside repository
     via the context menu.
